# Nussinov's Algorithm 

Implementation of Nussinov's Algorithm: a nucleic acid structure prediction algorithm used in computational biology to predict the folding of an RNA molecule that makes use of dynamic programming principles. The algorithm was developed by Ruth Nussinov in the late 1970s.

To run the performance test of the algorithm use the following command:

```bash
python performance_test.py 
```

You may also input your own RNA sequence using:

```
python main.py <sequence>
```
